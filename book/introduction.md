NodeJS.is a hot technology nowadays with lots of ways to build web/service applications. This can be considered a positive thing, but with it comes a problem of choosing the right way. This can be quite time consuming for an application team who strives for quality as it would have to go through multiple iterations building the framework that needs to support business logic of many applications in years to come. Here at eBay NodeJS platform team has gone through those iterations and now provides guidance and solutions for repetitive tasks that each app team would do as they build their application. This is also very important from maintenance perspective, with 100+ to potentially 1000+applications in future, the platform team focuses on providing quality and uniform solutions that can be reused across different applications. This on-line book reviews design challenges and solutions a developer team faces when building scalable web and service flows using eBay open-sourced Trooba framework https://github.com/trooba/trooba.
